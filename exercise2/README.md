# Exercise 2

The `cpp` directory contains a simple C++ code to construct and manage a shopping list. The `main` function performs some basic operations and prints the list. To build, you simply need to run `make`, and then you can run it with `./shoppinglist`. In this case, there are two separate bugs in the code! One of them causes a noticeable effect on the output, but the second one is sneaky and harder to figure out.

Again, the `rust` directory contains some scaffolding to help you translate the algorithm into Rust. Finish the algorithm to find out what the issues were and how Rust prevents us from running into them. To build and run it, go to the `rust` directory and use `cargo run`.
